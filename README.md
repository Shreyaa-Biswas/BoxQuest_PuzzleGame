# BoxQuest_PuzzleGame
The BoxQuest_PuzzleGame is an engaging and interactive game designed to challenge players to guide a box through a maze, starting from a designated point and reaching the goal. The game requires strategic thinking to minimize the number of moves while adhering to both a move count limit and a time constraint.

Here is an improved description for your GitHub README:

## Features
- **Intuitive Controls**: Use the arrow keys (← ↑ → ↓) to control the movement of the player and the box.
- **Move Count & Time Tracking**: The game keeps track of your moves and remaining time, challenging you to minimize both.
- **Restart Option**: Restart the game at any time to rethink your strategy.
- **Exit Functionality**: Easily exit the game with a single command.
- **Feedback System**: Displays success or failure messages in the lower-left corner to give you instant feedback on your progress.
